# RV32I RISC-V CPU Core

## Overview

This project implements a RISC-V CPU core based on the RV32I (32-bit integer) instruction set architecture using Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog). It demonstrates a functional CPU design that can execute the base integer instruction set of RISC-V.

## Features

- Full implementation of RV32I instruction set
- Designed using TL-Verilog for improved productivity and readability
- Simulated and tested using the Makerchip IDE
- Pipeline stages include Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of computer architecture
- Familiarity with Verilog or hardware description languages
- Access to Makerchip IDE (free, web-based)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Monish-VR/RISC-V-CPU-Core.git

2. Open the Makerchip IDE in your web browser: https://www.makerchip.com/sandbox/
3. Load the TL-Verilog files into Makerchip
4. Run simulations and view waveforms to understand the CPU's operation
